My first mobile app created in 2015\
Developed using Android studio with dummy location for green and danger zone.\
it was developed to help with the increasing number of snatch thief, stalking and even kidnapping crime occured.\
When you enter a danger zone, the app would send a message to your saved number. The message would be sent with a single push button.\

The idea of getting the app to send the message with a tap pattern is still under development. The tap series is taken from LG Tap Pattern Screen Lock where the phone will open the set apps with certain Tap Pattern.\

With the tap pattern, it is more efficient & a quick action to send Help Message when someone is in danger without alarming the bad guys
